# Unity Machine Learning Environments (WIP)

This is a collection of several game simulations made with [Unity's ML Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). These serve as test bed for machine learning approaches such as Deep Reinforcement Learning. As this is work in progress, more distinctive environments will be added in the near future. These environments are going to focus on varying kinds of challenges:

 - Discrete/Continuous action spaces
 - State Input made of raw pixels
 - Curriculum Learning
 - Imitation Learning
 - Cooperative Agents (among other agents)
 - Competitive Agents (among other agents)
 - ...

## Usage

All environments are based on [Unity's ML Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). Please follow their instructions and references to setup your Python environment.

## Available Environments
- [Basket Catch](documentation/BasketCatch.md)
	- continuous inputs
	- discrete outputs

## Potential Future Environments
Upcoming:
